# Project Name TDD

Author: ?

## Context and Scope

<!-- Give the readers a rough overview of what is going to be built and any background information theyâ€™ll need to understand it. -->

?

## Goals and Non-Goals

<!-- A short list of bullet points of what the goals of the system are, and, sometimes more importantly, what non-goals are. -->

?

## Design

<!--
- Write down the trade-offs you made in designing your software.
- Focus on those trade-offs to produce a useful document with long-term value.
- Suggest solutions and show why a particular solution best satisfies those goals
-->

### Overview

?

### Topics

#### System-context-diagram

<!-- Block diagram showing how various systems are related to each other. -->

?

#### APIs

<!-- If the system under design exposes an API, then sketching out that API is usually a good idea. -->

?

#### Data storage

<!-- Systems that store data should likely discuss how and in what rough form this happens. -->

?

#### Code and pseudo-code

<!-- Include code, or pseudo-code for things like algorithms or especially complex or important logic. -->

?

## Alternatives Considered

<!-- List alternative designs that would have reasonably achieved similar outcomes and focus on the trade-offs. -->

?

## Cross-cutting concerns

<!-- Add short sections that describe other concerns and how they'll be addressed. Examples: privacy and security -->
