# Creating Portfolios for Engineers

_Watch my talk at [Women Who Code CONNECT Recharge 2022](https://hopin.com/events/connect-recharge-2022/registration)!_

I rebuilt [my portfolio site](https://christylaguardia.com/projects) over a dozen times! Why? Because I didn’t know what to avoid when creating one! If you’re in job hunting mode a well-crafted portfolio could help you stand out. In this talk, I’ll show all the mistakes I made and how you can avoid them.

## Avoid these mistakes I made

1. Spending way too much time on it.
2. Building it from scratch.
3. Selecting the wrong portfolio pieces.
4. Having an unclear presentation of them.
5. Over and under designing my portfolio.
6. Don’t bury your contact info.
7. Not sharing it!
